# Planning-for-Microwave-Ablation-Thermal-Field-Parameters
code for microwave ablation parameters estimation

ui.py is used for model encapsulation and interface design

model.py contains the models used in this project. To make it clearï¼Œwe only put the most critical code in the file. This is because the codes such as image input will vary due to different data sets

In addtion,In order to better display the functions of the system, we applied the application in Baidu Netdisk

If you are interested in this system, just download and run the .exe file. (The compressed package is a little bit large)
